/*
   3. The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, â€¦
   where the first two terms are 0 and 1,
   and each term thereafter is the sum of the two preceding terms.
   Write a C++ program that repeatedly prompts for and reads a positive value n,
   calls a recursive function fibonnaci to calculate the nth  number in the Fibonacci sequence,
   and then displays the number. For example, if n = 9, then the program would display 21.
   Here is the output from a sample run of the program (user input in bold):
   Fibonnaci number generator Which one do you want (negative to exit)? 4
   The 4th Fibbonaci number is 2 Which one do you want (negative to exit)? 5
   The 5th Fibbonaci number is 3 Which one do you want (negative to exit)? 6
   The 6th Fibbonaci number is 5 Which one do you want (negative to exit)? 7
   The 7th Fibbonaci number is 8 Which one do you want (negative to exit)? -1
