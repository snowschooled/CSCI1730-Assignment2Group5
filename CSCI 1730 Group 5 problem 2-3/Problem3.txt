3. The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, â€¦
where the first two terms are 0 and 1,
and each term thereafter is the sum of the two preceding terms.
Write a C++ program that repeatedly prompts for and reads a positive value n,
calls a recursive function fibonnaci to calculate the nth  number in the Fibonacci sequence,
and then displays the number. For example, if n = 9, then the program would display 21.
Here is the output from a sample run of the program (user input in bold):
Fibonnaci number generator Which one do you want (negative to exit)? 4
The 4th Fibbonaci number is 2 Which one do you want (negative to exit)? 5
The 5th Fibbonaci number is 3 Which one do you want (negative to exit)? 6
The 6th Fibbonaci number is 5 Which one do you want (negative to exit)? 7
The 7th Fibbonaci number is 8 Which one do you want (negative to exit)? -1
